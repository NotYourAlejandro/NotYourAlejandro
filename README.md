# Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Alex, I've been a programmer/software dev for ~8 years, and I'm a current Computer Science student. I currently work as a systems administrator for my university's HPC cluster writing Bash scripts to automate as much as possible.

## My Languages and Skillsets

- **Python**
- C
- Javascript

## My Projects

Unfortunately, most of my projects are private work so you won't see much here. I'll try to be more proactive in the future with publishing my work.
